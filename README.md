# Custom-Memory-Allocator-Implementation
This project was a part of course Operating System CS518 Rutgers University. 
We have created our own memory allocator mirroring the functionality of malloc and free function using static 10MB memory.
To run the project, run make command and then run ./memgrind.c to run all the memory allocation test.
